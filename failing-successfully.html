<p>Failure. The #1 thing that almost all people avoid. Should we avoid it, or should we embrace it as an opportunity? Thomas Edison is quoted with having said he never failed, but rather found 10,000 ways that didn’t work. What an incredibly optimistic attitude. Sadly, many people look at failure as the end or they allow the fear of failure to cripple them and prevent any progress. For this to change it will require a change in perspective. So just how can we reframe failure to become encouragement and momentum? Let’s take a look at three successful individuals and how they utilized failure as a tool on their path to success </p>
<h3>J.K. Rowling</h3>
<p>Before becoming the wildly successful author of the <em>Harry Potter</em> series, J.K. Rowling had experienced the greatest failures of her life. With a recently imploded marriage, a young daughter, and an old typewriter, this jobless, single mother set out to find success. What felt like rock bottom became the springboard that catapulted her to seeing an idea become reality that impacted millions across the globe. While in what felt like the darkest dungeon, she found that all the inessentials had been stripped away and with her back against the wall she found a will she never knew existed. Having nothing else to lose, this failure experience gave her a gift that in turn sparked imagination in an entire generation of children (and adults). J.K Rowling’s story shows the clarity and simplicity that can be found when we see failure through the right lens.</p>
<h3>Teddy Roosevelt</h3>
<p>While growing up TR didn’t have it easy. It was apparent that something wasn’t quite right with his lungs. After many years and many doctors, TR’s father sat him down and told him if her were going to overcome this issue it would be through hard work. TR could have become depressed and allowed himself to come up with excuses, but instead he channeled that setback to become physically strong. This experience as a young child transformed him and created such grit that many later felt there was nothing he couldn’t do. Later in life, whether experiencing the stress of war, loss of loved ones, or political pressure, TR never lost his grit or let what happened to him or his failures define him. A setback or failure simply became an opportunity to find a creative solution or to soldier on. We, like TR, can learn not to run from failure, but rather to embrace it and allow it to harden our grit and become a driving force for success.</p>
<h3>Jesse Livermore</h3>
<p>Few names are as well known on wall street as Jesse Livermore. With the mythical status given to him through Edwin Lefèvre’s book <em>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</em>, Livermore has become one whom many trader’s hold as a hero. Having made and lost millions during his lifetime, Jesse was no stranger to the discouragement of failure. One of his biggest setbacks occurred when he was trading in cotton and wheat commodities, with a net worth of $5 million (in 1915), Jesse went against his typical trading rules while simultaneously being double-crossed by an associate. These two mistakes cost him $4.5 million. In his own words, “He hit a cold streak, and everything he touched turned into a loser.” After this experience Jesse reflected and vowed to get back his losses. Failure isn’t permanent and if we can put the failures behind us after learning the lesson, then we, like Jesse, can push onward for yet another adventure.</p>
