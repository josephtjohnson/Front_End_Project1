<h3>Persistence</h3>
<p>One word that strikes fear in the heart of many. Oxford Languages defines persistence as</p>
<q><b>firm or obstinate continuance in a course of action in spite of difficulty or opposition.</b></q>
<p>With that definition in mind you may be wondering what persistence has to do with trying. When many people think about trying they think of the "first steps" they never think about persistence until they are many steps down the road. Many times the jolt of passion makes the first step easy, but, as so many have found, passion diminishes over time. As the fires of passion begin to wane frustration can begin to take hold. Over time this frustration will cause us to become disenchanted with the pursuit, bored, and even discouraged. When this begins to occur we find oursevles searching for other places to get the excitement, the feel-good dopamine hit in the brain, and something that makes us feel like we are progressing. This is a cycle goes around and around like an emotional merry-go-round while never achieving anything. There has to be a better way.</p>

<p>I have good news for you you continue to find yourself on the merry-go-round - you can choose to get off at anytime. You may be saying, "Oh, I can?" or "If it were that easy I would have done it!". I said all of those things as well until I decided to take hold of one of the greatest traits we as humans can cultivate - persitence. Persistence is the key that unlocks the door to achieving our goals. As passion begins to fade we set our sites on small, attainable goals that we can reach. These small goals give us the psychological boost and fuel our momentum to continue forward. As we begin to check-off our small goals we find that we making consistent progress toward our main goal! The old adage rings true time and time again: you can do anything you put your mind to! Don't let the emotional ups and downs rob you of achieving what you set your sights on. Take hold of persistence and couple it to the "jet engine" of goal-setting and watch as you step off the carnival ride and begin to enjoy life once more, or maybe for the first time. </p>
