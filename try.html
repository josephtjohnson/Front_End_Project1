            <p>Are we confined to the absolutes of “do or do not” or is there value in the process and act of trying? Let’s find out.</p>
            <p>When we begin making our way through life, moving from child to adult, we are faced with many decisions. Many times, these decisions paralyze us as we are afraid of making the wrong one. With the grasp of “what-if” firmly around our mind, we inevitably and unknowingly make a decision – inaction. Dietrich Bonhoeffer once said, “Not to act is to act.” but so many people fail to see inaction as a choice. With fear clouding their vision they sit idly by on the banks as opportunity drifts further down the river of life. What is the remedy?</p>
            <p>Try. This one simple word carries with it endless possibilities. The simple act of choosing to engage can be a life-altering experience. Is it that simple? Yes, but there are a few ingredients needed to give energy to that first step. Let’s see how each gives rise to the next.

            <h3>Focus</h3>
            <p>In a world with endless opportunities choosing the best one can feel nearly impossible. The truth is many of the paths in life are not right or wrong, but rather good, better, or best. The issue that many of us have is finding a path to even start down, let alone choosing the best option. So how is it that we find the focus needed to begin? It can be as simple as answering a few questions:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>What opportunities are in front of me?</li>
              <li>What do my personality and interests line up with?</li>
              <li>What do I want to do?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These may appear simple, but the answers can clear the “fog” enough to see the path ahead. With a glimmer of an idea in mind we move on to the next ingredient.

            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <p>What does it mean to prepare? Is that simply making a list, gathering all the needed items, or stocking up a bunker in the basement. Definitely not! Preparing (and not for doomsday) is looking forward at the intended path and asking yourself, “What do I need to begin this journey?” Maybe that is insight from a mentor, reading some books, or spending time deeply reflecting (I would suggest all three!). As the path is perceived many more rational and irrational questions will arise. The preparation stage is when we weed out the irrational and seek to answer the rational. How much time does this take? Answer: as much as you allow it. If no clear deadline is set then preparation can turn into overanalyzing, leading to fear and inevitably, inaction. Set the deadline, write down the questions, and make the plan to answer them. When successfully completed we will find ourselves ready to move forward.

            <h3>Courage</h3>
            <p>We all have watched the movies, heard the tale, or read the story where the main character appears fearless and always triumphs despite impossible odds. Although these stories are encouraging, they portray these individuals as superhuman, and, therefore, many people feel as though they cannot relate. The truth is courage and fear coexist. Courage is choosing to act even in the face of fear. It isn’t recklessly choosing a decision, but it an ability that results from conviction. Even though it scares me, I know this is the decision I want to make. This conviction can only come from focusing and preparing. With this conviction we find courage to take the most difficult step, the first one, and start on a new adventure. Despite what fear may be telling us we are ready because we prepared.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>A final word. Grandmaster Yoda with all his wisdom could maybe see things we could not, so for us padawans still learning the way, we don’t fear the act of trying. Choosing to do or not to do is never the point but rather the end results of the 3 steps mentioned above. It takes just as much courage to do something as it does to choose not to. The choice is where the battle lies. Through preparation we learn what path or decision may truly be “worth it”. Sometimes we may find that the path we focused on wasn’t the best one and if so, great! Have the courage to walk away, reassess and start once more. Other times we will have the courage to take the first step only to find out we see the better way or that this direction altogether is not what we want. This too is perfect, and it is what trying is all about. We focus, prepare, have the courage to make the decision (do or do not), and we try. Learning through experience, whether it means continuing or starting over, will always make us better prepared the next time.</p>
